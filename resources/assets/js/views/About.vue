      <p>This project began from the amazement of seeing a planet in the sky seem to move in reverse from it's original path. As an avid skywatcher, observing this phenomenon always made me wonder why this occurs and how I can find out what other planets were in retrograde. That lead to the creation of this website which is now in version 2. The first attempt at making this site resulted in a bad UI and no interactivity at all. With this site, we can now see the data for previous and next days, as well as search for any day of the 2018 year.</p>

      <p>What does is mean when a planet goes retrograde? Retrograde motion is the apparent reversal of a planets path in the sky. The key is understanding that it does not mean the planet <em>actually</em> moves backwards in its orbit. It just appears to do so because of the relative positions of the planet being observed, Earth and how they move around the Sun. <a href="https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question46.html" target="_blank">CLICK HERE</a> to find out more how this occurs.</p>
